Current todo:

- Go through papers in the description of models and describe how they work (look at slides)
- Design a structure for final evaluation
- Design pipeline with input sentences and vocab
- More complex examples, "From the house of ... "
- Look at the errors in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318740296_Deep_Semantic_Role_Labeling_What_Works_and_What%27s_Next
- check github probbank predicate frames


Frequency:
- add to the top and bottom 500 words from the list - PoS tagging
- then prepare lists of nouns, and filter them manually
- create maybe 4 lists for sentences that take two input vocab


Pipeline:
- prepare general shared functions
- test with 5 different forms of sentences per each test
- find way to compare the results

- add lexicon from csv?

New plan

1. Prepare same structure everywhere with proper expected arguments (1 sentence per each)
      - fix the exemplary sentence in negation file
      - add low and high frequency word lists to the file
      - modify the output of passive file
      - modify the output of question file
      - modify the output of synonyms file 

2. Test that everything works 
3. Prepare evaluation metrics (check which one that was supposed to be)

4. Update readme! after the test changes
